I am doing my PhD at [York University](https://www.yorku.ca/) under the supervision of [Dr. Kostantinos Derpanis](https://cs.ryerson.ca/~kosta/) where I am doing research in explainable computer vision with a focus on image and video understanding tasks. I am currently a research intern at [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/) on the machine learning team and a faculty affiliate researcher at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). Previously I was the Lead Scientist in Residence at [NextAI](https://www.nextcanada.com/next-ai/) from 2020-2022. 

I completed a Bachelors of Applied Science (B.A.Sc) in [Applied Mathematics and Engineering](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/mthe) with a specialization in Mechanical Engineering at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/) in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. After graduating from my Bachelors degree, I worked at [Morrison Hershfield](https://www.morrisonhershfield.com) as a mechanical design engineer (in training). I designed buildings, labratories, and condos, with a team of other mechanical, evironmental, electrical, and control engineers. I then obtained my M.Sc at the [Ryerson Vision Lab](https://ryersonvisionlab.github.io/) in August 2020 under the co-supervision of [Dr. Neil Bruce]([https://cs.ryerson.ca/~bruce/](https://socs.uoguelph.ca/~brucen/)) and [Dr. Kosta Derpanis](https://cs.ryerson.ca/~kosta/). My M.Sc thesis focused on multi-modal action recognition. 

My hobbies include health and fitness, competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee, birds, close up magic, and progressive house music.
