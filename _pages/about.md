I completed a Bachelors of Applied Science (B.A.Sc) in [Applied Mathematics and Engineering](https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/mthe) with a specialization in Mechanical Engineering at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/) in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. My [capstone project](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08914) was done on eye-tracking for the purpose of preventing driver inattention in automobiles. 

After graduating, I worked for two years at [Morrison Hershfield](https://www.morrisonhershfield.com) as a mechanical design engineer (in training). I worked on a team with mechanical, evironmental, electrical, and control engineers on buildings, labratories, and condos. Some projects I worked on were: 1 Bloor East Condominium, Guelph Ontario Veterinarian College - Production Animal Isolation Facility, TTC McNicoll Bus Garage, and a University of Toronto Sandford Rooftop Physics Lab.

I then obtained my M.Sc at the [Ryerson Vision Lab](https://ryersonvisionlab.github.io/) in August 2020 under the co-supervision of [Dr. Neil Bruce](https://cs.ryerson.ca/~bruce/) and [Dr. Kosta Derpanis](https://cs.ryerson.ca/~kosta/). My M.Sc thesis focused on action recognition and weakly supervised semantic segmentation. I have worked as a Scientist in Residence at [NextAI](https://www.nextcanada.com/next-ai/) for the past three years, where I work closely with multiple AI-based startups in Toronto. My role was to be a research consultant where I would help the teams implement and understand state-of-the-art research papers which relate to their business or product. Here are a short list of the companies I worked with: [Origami-XR](https://www.origami-xr.com/), [Future Fertility](https://futurefertility.com/), [VideoLogic](https://www.videologic.io/), [NoLeak Defence](https://www.noleak.io/), [Argentum](https://www.argentum.ai/).

I am currently doing my PhD under the supervision of [Dr. Kosta Derpanis](https://cs.ryerson.ca/~kosta/) at [York University](https://www.yorku.ca/). I am also a postgraduate affiliate at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). My research focuses on building interpretable computer vision algorithms for video-based deep learning models.

My hobbies include health and fitness, competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee, birds, close up magic, and progressive house music.
