- People are upset that scaling DNNs works so well and solves so many problems in the field. 
- If DNNs are actually solving a bunch of problems, then this is a good thing because we should be getting downstream applications that help a ton of people
- Otherwise, if DNNs can't solve everything, then there are clearly still open research challenges to tackle
- Can’t have it both ways! DNNs can’t just scale to solve everything AND not be able to solve certain useful tasks.
- Also, why are you doing research in the first place? Is it for your ego or is it to create useful technology?
